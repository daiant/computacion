'diary' is a built-in function from the file libinterp/corefcn/pager.cc

 -- diary
 -- diary on
 -- diary off
 -- diary FILENAME
     Record a list of all commands _and_ the output they produce, mixed
     together just as they appear on the terminal.

     Valid options are:

     on
          Start recording a session in a file called 'diary' in the
          current working directory.

     off
          Stop recording the session in the diary file.

     FILENAME
          Record the session in the file named FILENAME.

     With no arguments, 'diary' toggles the current diary state.

     See also: history, evalc.
